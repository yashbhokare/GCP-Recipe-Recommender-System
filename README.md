Hunger hurts: Food Recommendation System

Introduction

In our hectic daily lives, we frequently forget to buy groceries. It is not uncommon for us to decide to make a recipe only to discover that we lack all of the necessary ingredients, forcing us to either abandon the plan or pay a higher price for the ingredients. To tackle this issue in general, we present a website that analyzes users' weekly meal plan and assists him in following it in a most efficient way.

Aim: To create a web application for maintaining and analyzing a user's weekly meal schedule, as well as assisting him with it by suggesting the recipe, listing the ingredients needed, and providing their current prices, as well as interactively assisting him in preparing the dish by reading out the recipe to him.
